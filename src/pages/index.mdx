# Overview

Perception is an API route designed for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from base64 encoded images. It integrates [**convert-base64-to-image**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-base64-to-image) and [**tesseract.js**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js/v/2.1.1):

- [**convert-base64-to-image**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-base64-to-image): decodes base64 image data into a file format recognisable by tesseract.js.
- [**tesseract.js**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tesseract.js/v/2.1.1): utilises the Tesseract OCR engine to accurately extract text from images.

Perception simplifies the process of extracting text from images by combining these libraries, to provides a simple method for developers to integrate OCR functionality into their applications.
